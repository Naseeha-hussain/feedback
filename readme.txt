Greetings From Dr. Tutorial

We would like to inform you that we are here with Faculty Feedback system. The faculty feedback system has two panels. 
Student and Admin Panel .
In student panel there is no login, the student just needs to enter his name and email address which is not visible to admin. 
In the respect to keep the students identity secured , we have not displayed his credidentials. 
The feedback is more important to improve the quality of education. From students panel, the student will first need to choose the faculty for which he is writing the feedback. 
After choosing the the faulty name , he will need to choose the subject for which he is writing the feedback. 
Feedback once written cannot be altered or changed. 
student can write the feedback of only one faculty for a particular subject at a time. He will need to again enter if he wish to wirte the feedback of another faculty. 
In admin panel , there is no registration. Required .

Please create a database feedback and import the sql files in the database and the project will run .
In the Admin panel admin can add a faculty, delete a faculty, edit a faculty. Similar wise he can add subjects, edit subjects, and delete subjects. 
Once the subject and faculty data is inserted , he will need to allot the subjects to the faculty. Once the subject is alloted , then it will be displayed for feedback.
